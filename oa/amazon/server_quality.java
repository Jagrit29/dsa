// # Ensure the server quality by:

// # â€¢ Each of the packets must be sent via a Single Channel.
// # â€¢ Each of the channels must transfer at least one packet.

// # The quality of the transfer for a channel is defined by the median of the sizes of all the data packets sent through that channel.

// # Note: The median of an array is the middle element if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the number of elements in the array is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

// # Find the maximum possible sum of the qualities of all channels. If the answer is a floating-point value, round it to the next higher integer.

// # Example
// # packets = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// # channels = 2
// # At least one packet has to go through each of the 2 channels. One maximal solution is to transfer packets {1, 2, 3, 4} through channel
// # The quality of transfer for channel 1 is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5 and that of channel 2 is 5. Their sum is 2.5 + 5 = 7.5 which rounds up to 8.

// # packets = [2, 2, 1, 5, 3]
// # channels = 2
// # output = 7

// # packets = [89, 48, 14]
// # channels = 3
// # output = 151
